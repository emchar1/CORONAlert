# CORONAlert
Obtain the latest COVID-19 information based on your current location.

Since the App Store is not accepting apps created by individuals surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, I've decided to upload my project here in hopes it can benefit anyone interested in the data. The data comes from COVID-19 Statistics API on rapidapi.com, which itself is based on public data by Johns Hopkins CSSE.

Once you've cloned the project, you'll need to create an account on https://rapidapi.com to get your own API key. Then add the following constant to your project:

let rapidAPIKey = "<your_api_key>"

where <your_api_key> is your personal API key as a string value.
